  ladder,
  strategy
}): Recommendation {
  // Guardrails
  if (market.count < 4) return { error: "insufficient_data" };
  
  // Apply strategy
  switch (strategy) {
    case "median":
      return round(market.median);
    case "win":
      return market.min * 0.99; // 1% below min
    case "hold":
      return clamp(yourPrice, p40, p60);
    case "custom":
      return market.median * (1 + customDelta);
  }
  
  // Simulate new rank
  const newRank = simulateRank(suggested, ladder);
  
  return { suggested, expectedRank: newRank };
}
```
