};
```

**SQL for Event Detection:**
```sql
-- Price Changes (run after each scrape)
INSERT INTO market_events (type, timestamp, store_id, variant_id, old_price, new_price)
SELECT 
  CASE 
    WHEN curr.price < prev.price THEN 'price_drop'
    WHEN curr.price > prev.price THEN 'price_increase'
  END as type,
  NOW() as timestamp,
  curr.store_id,
  curr.variant_id,
  prev.price as old_price,
  curr.price as new_price
FROM daily_variant_store curr
JOIN daily_variant_store prev 
  ON curr.store_id = prev.store_id 
  AND curr.variant_id = prev.variant_id
  AND prev.date = curr.date - INTERVAL '1 day'
WHERE curr.date = CURRENT_DATE
  AND curr.price != prev.price
  AND ABS(curr.price - prev.price) >= 0.50; -- Filter noise

-- New SKUs
INSERT INTO market_events (type, timestamp, store_id, variant_id, new_price)
SELECT 
  'new_sku' as type,
  NOW() as timestamp,
  curr.store_id,
  curr.variant_id,
  curr.price as new_price
FROM daily_variant_store curr
LEFT JOIN daily_variant_store prev
  ON curr.store_id = prev.store_id 
  AND curr.variant_id = prev.variant_id
  AND prev.date < curr.date
WHERE curr.date = CURRENT_DATE
  AND prev.variant_id IS NULL;

-- Restocks (out of stock → in stock)
INSERT INTO market_events (type, timestamp, store_id, variant_id)
SELECT 
  'restock' as type,
  NOW() as timestamp,
  curr.store_id,
  curr.variant_id
FROM daily_variant_store curr
JOIN daily_variant_store prev
  ON curr.store_id = prev.store_id 
  AND curr.variant_id = prev.variant_id
  AND prev.date = curr.date - INTERVAL '1 day'
WHERE curr.date = CURRENT_DATE
  AND curr.in_stock = true
  AND prev.in_stock = false;

-- Out of Stock (in stock → out of stock)
INSERT INTO market_events (type, timestamp, store_id, variant_id)
SELECT 
  'oos' as type,
  NOW() as timestamp,

---

#### **Tab 1: Price Recommendations** 💰

**What It Does:**
Smart pricing recommendations based on competitive positioning and strategy.

**Features:**
- 4 pricing strategies:
  1. **Match Median** - Stay competitive with market average
  2. **Win the Aisle** - Beat lowest competitor by 1-2%
  3. **Hold Margin** - Stay within p40-p60 band
  4. **Custom** - Apply custom % adjustment

**Metrics Shown:**
- Your current price
- Market range (min / median / p90)
- Recommended price
- Current rank (e.g., #7 of 8 stores)
- Expected rank after change (e.g., → #4)
- Gap to median ($ and %)
- Data quality confidence score (85-100%)
- Estimated revenue impact

**Calculation Logic:**

```typescript
// 1. Calculate Market Statistics
function calculateMarketStats(prices: number[]) {
  return {
    min: Math.min(...prices),
    median: percentile(prices, 50),
    p25: percentile(prices, 25),
    p40: percentile(prices, 40),
    p60: percentile(prices, 60),
    p90: percentile(prices, 90),
    max: Math.max(...prices),
    count: prices.length,
  };
}

// 2. Calculate Current Rank
function rankInLadder(yourPrice: number, allPrices: number[]) {
  const sorted = [...allPrices].sort((a, b) => a - b);
  return sorted.filter(p => p < yourPrice).length + 1;
}

// 3. Suggest Price by Strategy
function suggestPrice(
  strategy: string,
  yourPrice: number,
  marketStats: MarketStats
): number {
  let suggested: number;
  
  switch (strategy) {
    case "median":
      suggested = marketStats.median;
      break;
      
    case "win":
      // Beat lowest by 1%
      suggested = marketStats.min * 0.99;
      break;
      
    case "hold":
      // Clamp to p40-p60 band
      if (yourPrice < marketStats.p40) {
        suggested = marketStats.p40;
      } else if (yourPrice > marketStats.p60) {
        suggested = marketStats.p60;
      } else {
        suggested = yourPrice; // Already in band
      }
      break;
      
    case "custom":
      // Apply custom delta (e.g., -5%)
      suggested = marketStats.median * (1 + customDeltaPct / 100);
      break;
  }
  
  // Round to nearest $0.10
  return Math.round(suggested * 10) / 10;
}

// 4. Calculate Gap
function calculateGap(yourPrice: number, marketMedian: number) {
  const gap = yourPrice - marketMedian;
  const gapPercent = (gap / marketMedian) * 100;
  return { gap, gapPercent };
}

// 5. Confidence Score
function confidenceScore(
  storeCount: number,
  dataAge: number, // hours
  mappingConfidence: number // 0-1
): number {
  let score = 100;
  
  // Penalize low sample size
  if (storeCount < 4) score -= 20;
  else if (storeCount < 6) score -= 10;
  
  // Penalize stale data
  if (dataAge > 48) score -= 20;
  else if (dataAge > 24) score -= 10;
  
  // Factor in mapping quality
  score *= mappingConfidence;
  
  return Math.max(50, Math.min(100, Math.round(score)));
}

// 6. Estimate Revenue Impact
function estimateImpact(
  currentPrice: number,
  suggestedPrice: number,
  currentRank: number,
  expectedRank: number,
  monthlyVolume: number // estimated units/month
): string {
  const priceDelta = suggestedPrice - currentPrice;
  
  if (priceDelta < 0) {
    // Price decrease → volume increase
    const rankImprovement = currentRank - expectedRank;
    const volumeIncrease = rankImprovement * 0.15; // 15% per rank
    const revenueIncrease = monthlyVolume * volumeIncrease * suggestedPrice;
    return `+$${Math.round(revenueIncrease)}/mo from increased volume`;
  } else {
    // Price increase → margin increase
    const marginIncrease = priceDelta * monthlyVolume;
    return `+$${Math.round(marginIncrease)}/mo from improved margin`;
  }
}
```

**SQL for Production:**
```sql
-- Get market stats for a variant
WITH market_prices AS (
  SELECT 
    store_id,
    price,
    in_stock,
    last_seen
  FROM daily_variant_store
  WHERE variant_id = ?
    AND date = CURRENT_DATE
    AND store_id IN (SELECT store_id FROM org_store_allowlist WHERE org_id = ?)
    AND in_stock = true
)
SELECT 
  MIN(price) as min_price,

#### **Tab 2: Sales Opportunities** 🏷️

**What It Does:**
Identifies when competitors are running promotions and recommends matching sales.

**Features:**
- Shows products where competitors are on sale
- Counts how many competitors (e.g., "4 of 8 stores")
- Calculates average discount % across competitors
- Recommends your sale pricing
- Urgency levels: High (4+ competitors) / Medium (3) / Low (1-2)
- Estimated sales volume impact

**Calculation Logic:**

```typescript
// 1. Detect Competitor Sales
function detectSales(variantId: string, stores: Store[]): SaleOpportunity {
  const competitorsOnSale = stores.filter(s => s.isSale).length;
  const totalCompetitors = stores.length;
  
  // Calculate average discount
  const saleStores = stores.filter(s => s.isSale);
  const avgRegularPrice = average(saleStores.map(s => s.regularPrice));
  const avgSalePrice = average(saleStores.map(s => s.salePrice));
  const avgDiscount = ((avgRegularPrice - avgSalePrice) / avgRegularPrice) * 100;
  
  return {
    competitorsOnSale,
    totalCompetitors,
    avgDiscount,
    penetration: (competitorsOnSale / totalCompetitors) * 100,
  };
}

// 2. Calculate Urgency
function calculateUrgency(penetration: number): "high" | "medium" | "low" {
  if (penetration >= 50) return "high";  // Half+ on sale
  if (penetration >= 37) return "medium"; // 3+ stores
  return "low";
}

// 3. Recommend Sale Price
function recommendSale(
  yourPrice: number,
  avgCompetitorSale: number,
  avgDiscount: number
): { price: number; discount: number } {
  // Match or slightly beat average discount
  const recommendedDiscount = Math.ceil(avgDiscount);
  const recommendedPrice = yourPrice * (1 - recommendedDiscount / 100);
  
  // Round to .99 or .49 endings
  const rounded = Math.floor(recommendedPrice) + 0.99;
  
  return {
    price: rounded,
    discount: ((yourPrice - rounded) / yourPrice) * 100,
  };
}

// 4. Estimate Impact
function estimateSaleImpact(
  urgency: string,
  categoryVelocity: number
): string {
  const baseIncrease = urgency === "high" ? 35 : urgency === "medium" ? 25 : 15;
  const velocityFactor = categoryVelocity > 5 ? 1.2 : 1; // High-volume categories
  
  const estimatedIncrease = Math.round(baseIncrease * velocityFactor);
  return `+${estimatedIncrease}% unit sales during promo period`;
}
```

**SQL for Production:**
```sql
-- Detect products with competitor sales
WITH competitor_sales AS (
  SELECT 
    variant_id,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE is_sale = true) as on_sale_count,
    COUNT(*) as total_stores,
    AVG(CASE WHEN is_sale THEN price END) as avg_sale_price,
    AVG(price) as avg_regular_price
  FROM daily_variant_store
  WHERE date = CURRENT_DATE
    AND store_id IN (SELECT store_id FROM org_store_allowlist WHERE org_id = ?)
    AND in_stock = true
  GROUP BY variant_id
  HAVING COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE is_sale = true) >= 2 -- At least 2 competitors
)
SELECT 
  v.id,
  p.brand,
  p.name || ' ' || v.size_text as product_name,
  p.category,
  cs.on_sale_count,
  cs.total_stores,
  cs.avg_sale_price,
  cs.avg_regular_price,
  ((cs.avg_regular_price - cs.avg_sale_price) / cs.avg_regular_price * 100) as avg_discount
FROM competitor_sales cs
JOIN product_variants v ON cs.variant_id = v.id
JOIN master_products p ON v.master_product_id = p.id
ORDER BY cs.on_sale_count DESC, avg_discount DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

#### **Tab 3: Inventory Insights** 📦

**What It Does:**
Recommends what to stock based on market velocity, turnover, and adoption trends.

**4 Insight Types:**

1. **Fast Mover - Stock More** 🟢
   - Products that sell out quickly at competitors
   - Avg days in stock: 2-4 days
   - Recommendation: Increase order quantity by 30-50%

2. **Consider Stocking** 🔵
   - High coverage (80%+) but you don't carry it
   - Recommendation: Add to core inventory

3. **Slow Mover - Reduce Stock** 🟠
   - Long shelf life (18+ days) and declining coverage
   - Recommendation: Reduce reorder by 40-50% or discontinue

4. **Trending Up - Stock Now** 🟣
   - Rapid market adoption (0% → 70%+ in 30-60 days)
   - Recommendation: Add immediately, stock heavily

**Metrics:**
- Avg days in stock across market
- Restock frequency pattern
- Market coverage % (how many stores carry it)
- Turnover velocity

**Calculation Logic:**

```typescript
// 1. Calculate Velocity (Days in Stock)
function calculateVelocity(variantId: string, days: number = 30): number {
  // Track when product goes from in_stock=true → in_stock=false
  const stockEvents = getStockEvents(variantId, days);
  
  const inStockDurations = stockEvents.map(event => {
    const restockDate = event.restock_date;
    const outOfStockDate = event.oos_date;
    return (outOfStockDate - restockDate) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24); // days
  });
  
  return average(inStockDurations);
}

// 2. Calculate Coverage
function calculateCoverage(variantId: string): number {
  const storesCarrying = countStoresWithProduct(variantId);
  const totalStoresInMarket = getTotalStores();
  return (storesCarrying / totalStoresInMarket) * 100;
}

// 3. Detect Trending Products
function detectTrending(variantId: string): boolean {
  const coverage30DaysAgo = getCoverageAtDate(variantId, daysAgo(30));
  const coverageToday = calculateCoverage(variantId);
  
  // Rapid adoption = went from <30% to >70% in 30 days
  return coverage30DaysAgo < 30 && coverageToday > 70;
}

// 4. Classify Products
function classifyProduct(
  avgDaysInStock: number,
  coverage: number,
  trending: boolean,
  youCarry: boolean
): InsightType {
  if (trending && avgDaysInStock < 5) {
    return {
      type: "trending",
      label: "Trending Up - Stock Now",
      color: "purple",
    };
  }
  
  if (avgDaysInStock <= 3 && coverage > 80) {
    return {
      type: "fast",
      label: "Fast Mover - Stock More",
      color: "green",
    };
  }
  
  if (coverage > 80 && !youCarry) {
    return {
      type: "add",
      label: "Consider Stocking",
      color: "blue",
    };
  }
  
  if (avgDaysInStock > 15 && coverage < 50) {
    return {
      type: "slow",
      label: "Slow Mover - Reduce Stock",
      color: "orange",
    };
  }
  
  return null;
}

// 5. Recommend Order Quantity Change
function recommendOrderChange(
  currentVelocity: number,
  marketVelocity: number
): { action: string; percent: number } {
  const ratio = marketVelocity / currentVelocity;
  
  if (ratio > 2) {
    // Market moves 2x faster than you
    return { action: "increase", percent: 50 };
  } else if (ratio > 1.5) {
    return { action: "increase", percent: 30 };
  } else if (ratio < 0.5) {
    // Market moves 2x slower
    return { action: "decrease", percent: 50 };
  } else if (ratio < 0.7) {
    return { action: "decrease", percent: 30 };
  }
  
  return { action: "maintain", percent: 0 };
}
```

**SQL for Production:**
```sql
-- Calculate velocity (avg days in stock)
WITH stock_durations AS (
  SELECT 
    variant_id,
    store_id,

   - Mass restock at 70%+ stores within 48h
   - Fresh shipment arrived
   - Action: Monitor for price competition/sales

4. **Market Exit** 🔴
   - Removed from ALL tracked stores
   - Product discontinued
   - Action: Immediate clearance (30-40% off)

**Detection Logic:**

```typescript
// 1. Detect Removal Trend
function detectRemovalTrend(variantId: string): Alert | null {
  const stores7DaysAgo = getStoresCarrying(variantId, daysAgo(7));
  const storesToday = getStoresCarrying(variantId, today());
  
  const removed = stores7DaysAgo.filter(s => !storesToday.includes(s));
  
  if (removed.length >= 3 && removed.length < stores7DaysAgo.length) {
    return {
      type: "removal_trend",
      severity: "high",
      details: `Removed from ${removed.length} of ${stores7DaysAgo.length} stores in past 7 days`,
      storesAffected: removed.map(s => s.name),
      recommendation: "Likely discontinued by LP - consider clearance pricing",
    };
  }
  
  return null;
}

// 2. Detect OOS Trend
function detectOOSTrend(variantId: string): Alert | null {
  const stores = getStoresCarrying(variantId);
  const oosStores = stores.filter(s => {
    const daysSinceInStock = getDaysSince(s.lastInStockDate);
    return !s.inStock && daysSinceInStock >= 3;
  });
  
  const oosPct = (oosStores.length / stores.length) * 100;
  
  if (oosPct >= 50 && oosStores.length >= 3) {
    return {
      type: "oos_trend",
      severity: oosPct > 70 ? "high" : "medium",
      details: `Out of stock at ${oosStores.length} of ${stores.length} stores for 3+ days`,
      storesAffected: oosStores.map(s => s.name),
      recommendation: "Supply constraint - premium pricing opportunity if in stock",
    };
  }
  
  return null;
}

// 3. Detect Mass Restock
function detectMassRestock(variantId: string): Alert | null {
  // Products that went from OOS → in stock in past 48h
  const restockedStores = getStoresWhere(variantId, store => {
    const hoursSinceRestock = getHoursSince(store.lastRestockDate);
    return store.inStock && hoursSinceRestock <= 48;
  });
  
  const totalStores = getStoresCarrying(variantId).length;
  const restockPct = (restockedStores.length / totalStores) * 100;
  
  if (restockPct >= 70 && restockedStores.length >= 5) {
    return {
      type: "restock_pattern",
      severity: "low",
      details: `Mass restock at ${restockedStores.length} stores within 48 hours`,
      storesAffected: ["All major competitors"],
      recommendation: "Fresh shipment - expect price competition",
    };
  }
  
  return null;
}

// 4. Detect Market Exit
function detectMarketExit(variantId: string): Alert | null {
  const stores14DaysAgo = getStoresCarrying(variantId, daysAgo(14));
  const storesToday = getStoresCarrying(variantId, today());
  
  if (stores14DaysAgo.length > 0 && storesToday.length === 0) {
    return {
      type: "market_exit",
      severity: "high",
      details: `Removed from all ${stores14DaysAgo.length} tracked stores over 14 days`,
      storesAffected: stores14DaysAgo.map(s => s.name),
      recommendation: "Product discontinued - immediate clearance sale needed",
    };
  }
  
  return null;
}
```

### 6. **Action List Tracking System**
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

**What It Is:**
Task management system for tracking recommendations users want to implement.

**Key Distinction:**
- LeafLedger is **NOT** connected to client POS systems
- This is a **planning and tracking tool** for recommendations
- Users manually implement changes in their own POS
- Then mark items as "Implemented" in LeafLedger

**Features:**
- **"Save to Action List"** button on all recommendations
- **Action List Drawer** - Slide-out panel showing saved items
- **3 Status Tabs:**
  1. **To Do** - Saved, pending implementation
  2. **Done** - Marked as implemented
  3. **Dismissed** - Decided not to use
- **Actions:**
  - Mark Implemented (moves to Done)
  - Dismiss (moves to Dismissed)
  - Restore (bring back dismissed items)
- **Export CSV** - Download action list for team meetings
- **Badge counter** - Shows count of saved items

**Data Structure:**
```typescript
type ActionItem = {
  id: string;
  type: "pricing" | "sales" | "inventory" | "alert";
  product: string;
  category: string;
  recommendation: string; // e.g., "Change price from $42.99 → $40.99"
  impact: string; // e.g., "+$2,400/mo estimated impact"
  status: "saved" | "implemented" | "dismissed";
  savedAt: Date;
  implementedAt?: Date;
  dismissedAt?: Date;
  notes?: string; // Future enhancement
};
```

**User Journey:**
```
1. Browse Market Advisor recommendations
2. Click "Save to Action List" on interesting items
3. Action List badge shows count (e.g., "Action List (3)")
4. Open drawer to review all saved items
5. Manually update prices in their POS (Cova, Dutchie, etc.)
6. Return to LeafLedger
7. Click "Mark Implemented" 
8. Item moves to Done tab
9. Export CSV at end of week to share with team
```

**Component:** `src/components/compare/action-list-drawer.tsx`

  lng: number;
  platform: "Buddi" | "Dutchie" | "Cova" | "Blaze" | "Other";
  active: boolean;
  last_scrape_at: Date;
};

// 2. Master Product
type MasterProduct = {
  id: string;

  new_price: number | null;
  change_percent: number | null;
  severity: "high" | "medium" | "low" | null;
};
```

### Data Collection Workflow

```
1. Web Scraping (Every 12 hours)
   ├─ Scrape store menu pages (Buddi, Dutchie, etc.)
   ├─ Extract: product name, brand, size, price, sale, stock status
   └─ Store in MenuObservation table

2. Product Mapping
   ├─ Match scraped items to MasterProduct/ProductVariant
   ├─ Use fuzzy matching + ML confidence scoring
   ├─ Store mappings with confidence scores
   └─ Flag low-confidence items for manual review

3. Daily Snapshot Creation
   ├─ Dedupe observations (take most recent)
   ├─ Write to DailyVariantStore table
   └─ Calculate normalized_price_per_g

4. Market Aggregation
   ├─ Calculate min/median/p90 across all stores
   ├─ Calculate coverage and promo rates
   └─ Write to DailyVariantMarket table

5. Event Detection
   ├─ Compare current snapshot to previous day
   ├─ Detect: price changes, restocks, OOS, removals
   └─ Write to MarketEvent table

6. Alert Processing
   ├─ Check event patterns (removal trends, OOS trends)
   ├─ Evaluate against user alert rules
   └─ Create AlertTrigger records
```

## 📖 Formula Reference

### Pricing Calculations

```typescript
// Gap to Median
gap_dollars = your_price - market_median
gap_percent = (gap_dollars / market_median) * 100

// Price Rank
rank = COUNT(competitors_with_lower_price) + 1

// Competitive Index (Dashboard)
competitive_index = (your_median_price / market_median_price) * 100
// 100 = at market, >100 = above market, <100 = below market

// Coverage
coverage = (skus_with_market_data / total_skus) * 100

// Price per Gram
price_per_gram = price / normalized_qty_g

// Confidence Score
confidence = 100
if (store_count < 4) confidence -= 20
if (data_age_hours > 48) confidence -= 20
if (mapping_confidence < 0.8) confidence -= 15
confidence = Math.max(50, confidence) // floor at 50
```

### Inventory Calculations

```typescript
// Velocity (Days in Stock)
velocity = AVG(date_oos - date_restock) across all restock cycles

// Coverage
coverage = (stores_carrying / total_stores_in_market) * 100

// Trending Detection
is_trending = (coverage_today > 70) && (coverage_30d_ago < 30)

// Growth Rate
growth_rate = ((coverage_today - coverage_past) / coverage_past) * 100
```

### Sales Opportunity Calculations

```typescript
// Promotion Penetration
promo_penetration = (stores_on_sale / total_stores) * 100

// Average Discount
avg_discount = AVG(
  ((regular_price - sale_price) / regular_price) * 100
) for stores_on_sale

// Urgency
if (promo_penetration >= 50) urgency = "high"
else if (promo_penetration >= 37) urgency = "medium"
else urgency = "low"

// Recommended Sale Price
recommended_price = your_price * (1 - CEIL(avg_discount) / 100)
// Round to .99 ending
```

### Market Alert Detection

```typescript
// Removal Trend
stores_removed = stores_7d_ago - stores_today
if (stores_removed >= 3) trigger_alert("removal_trend")

// OOS Trend
oos_stores = stores WHERE (in_stock = false AND days_since_in_stock >= 3)
oos_pct = (oos_stores.length / total_stores) * 100
if (oos_pct >= 50 && oos_stores.length >= 3) trigger_alert("oos_trend")

// Mass Restock
restocked_48h = stores WHERE (in_stock = true AND hours_since_restock <= 48)
restock_pct = (restocked_48h.length / total_stores) * 100
if (restock_pct >= 70 && restocked_48h.length >= 5) trigger_alert("restock_pattern")

// Market Exit
if (stores_14d_ago.length > 0 && stores_today.length === 0) trigger_alert("market_exit")
```
