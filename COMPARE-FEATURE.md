## How It Works

### The Algorithm (from `/lib/services/coach.ts`)

1. **Collect Data:**
   - Your current price
   - Market ladder (all competitor prices)
   - Market stats (min, median, p90)

2. **Apply Strategy:**
   - Match Median: `suggested = round(median)`
   - Win Aisle: `suggested = min * (1 - 0.01)` (1% below min)
   - Hold Margin: `suggested = clamp(price, p40, p60)`
   - Custom: `suggested = median * (1 + customDelta)`

3. **Guardrails:**
   - Reject if < 4 stores (insufficient data)
   - Flag if data > 48h old (stale)
   - Min step size of $0.10
   - Confidence scoring

4. **Simulate:**
   - Insert suggested price into ladder
   - Calculate new rank
   - Show expected position
